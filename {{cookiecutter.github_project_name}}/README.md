`{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}` is a Jupyter kernel for {{cookiecutter.language}} based on the native implementation of the
Jupyter protocol [xeus](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus).

## Installation

{{cookiecutter.package_name}} has not been packaged for the mamba (or conda) package manager.

To ensure that the installation works, it is preferable to install `{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}` in a
fresh environment. It is also needed to use a
[miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) or
[miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) installation because with the full
[anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) you may have a conflict with the `zeromq` library
which is already installed in the anaconda distribution.

The safest usage is to create an environment named `{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}`

```bash
mamba create -n  `{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}`
source activate  `{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}`
```

<!-- ### Installing from conda-forge

Then you can install in this environment `{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}` and its dependencies

```bash
mamba install`{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}` notebook -c conda-forge
``` -->

### Installing from source

Or you can install it from the sources, you will first need to install dependencies

```bash
mamba install cmake cxx-compiler xeus-zmq nlohmann_json cppzmq xtl jupyterlab -c conda-forge
```

Then you can compile the sources (replace `$CONDA_PREFIX` with a custom installation
prefix if need be)

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX -D CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib
make && make install
```
